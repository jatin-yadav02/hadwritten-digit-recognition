# hadwritten-digit-recognition
A machine learning project that recognizes handwritten digits (0–9) using image classification techniques. Built with Python and trained on the MNIST dataset, this project demonstrates the power of deep learning in computer vision tasks.

🔍 Overview

The Handwritten Digit Recognition system takes an input image of a digit and predicts the correct number using a trained neural network. This is a foundational computer vision project and a great example of how deep learning can be applied to real-world problems like document digitization and postal code recognition.

🛠️ Tech Stack
	•	Python
	•	TensorFlow / Keras (for building and training the model)
	•	NumPy & Matplotlib (for data handling and visualization)
	•	MNIST Dataset (standard dataset of 70,000 handwritten digits)
	•	Jupyter Notebook (for experimentation and visualization)

🚀 Features
	•	Trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for high accuracy
	•	Visualizes training performance (loss/accuracy graphs)
	•	Accepts new digit drawings for live predictions
	•	Easy-to-read and modular code

🧪 How to Run
	1.	Clone the repository
	2.	Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
	3.	Run the training notebook or script
	4.	Test the model with your own digit images or use the GUI (if implemented)

🎯 Accuracy

Achieves over 98% accuracy on the MNIST test set with a simple CNN architecture.

📌 Future Enhancements
	•	Add a web interface for real-time digit input
	•	Extend recognition to letters (A-Z)
	•	Deploy using Streamlit or Flask
